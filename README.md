# Techradar

This project, inspired by [Zalando's](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar) and [Miguel Silva's](https://github.com/miguel-silva/techradar)
techradar, enables users to generate a visualization representing the key frameworks, libraries, tools, platforms, and techniques used in
organizations. It also provides information regarding the adoption level of each of these elements. What sets this project apart from other 
libraries is its unique feature that allows users to customize the number of rings and slices according to their specific needs
